## Introduction:

**G.hn** is a specification for [home networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_networking) with data rates up to 2 Gbit/s and operation over four types of legacy wires: [telephone wiring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_wiring), [coaxial cables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coaxial_cable), [power lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_line) and [plastic optical fiber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_optical_fiber). A single G.hn semiconductor device is able to network over any of the supported home wire types. 

Some benefits of a multi-wire standard are lower equipment development costs and lower deployment costs for service providers (by allowing customer self-install).

**Disadvantage**:
